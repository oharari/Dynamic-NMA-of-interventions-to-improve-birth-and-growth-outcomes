# **About this application**

## **Background**
Despite improvements that have been made in the past decade, malnutrition and global burden of stunting in children are critical public health problems. Proper care and nutrition for children are critical. Previous reviews have showed different interventions related to antibiotics, deworming, food supplementation, kangaroo care, maternal education, micronutrient supplementation, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) that can potentially improve child birth outcomes. 

Moreover, Women's poor nutrition can lead to poor childbirth outcomes (i.e. preterm birth, stillbirth, and low birth weight) that can result in stunting. Previous reviews have showed different interventions related to nutrition, deworming, cash transfers, and influenza vaccines that can be offered to pregnant women for better childbirth outcomes;
However, in neither case, the comparative efficacy of these interventions is not well known.  
 

## **Objective**
The objective of this collection of studies was to determine the efficacy of interventions related to nutrition, cash transfers, influenza vaccine, and deworming for pregnant women on childbirth outcomes.
We also attempt to determine the efficacy of interventions related to antibiotics, deworming, food supplementation, kangaroo care, maternal education, micronutrient supplementation, and WASH on their growth outcomes of children. For the latter, we have divided our study into to separate age groups: children in the 0 - 6 months range and children between 6 and 24 months, to improve study homogeneity.  

##  **Methods**
A comprehensive systematic search of electronic databases was conducted in 2017-2019, using the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and MEDLINE. We searched for randomized clinical trials of nutrition and deworming interventions and comparative observational studies of cash transfers and influenza vaccines for pregnant women to improve childbirth outcomes (i.e. preterm birth, stillbirth, and low birth weight). We also searched for randomized clinical trials with interventions related to antibiotics, deworming, food supplementation, kangaroo care, maternal education, micronutrient supplementation, and WASH to improve child growth outcomes in low- and middle-income country settings. We used network meta-analysis (NMA, [read here for details](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0088912/pdf/PubMedHealth_PMH0088912.pdf)) to compare the efficacy of the different interventions).
